# Roar Fan Loyalty Platform – Terms of Service (Draft)

## Acceptance of Terms

Welcome to Roar, a fan engagement and loyalty platform ("Roar," "we," "us," or "our"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Roar website, mobile application, and related services (collectively, the "Service"). By creating an account or otherwise using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the Service.

We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by posting the revised Terms with a new effective date and, where appropriate, via email or in-app notification. Your continued use of the Service after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## Eligibility and Age Requirements

**Minimum Age:** You must be at least 13 years old to use our Service, and we do not allow anyone under 13 to register or use Roar. The Service is a general audience platform not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 in compliance with U.S. COPPA regulations.

**Users 13-17:** If you are between 13 and 17 years old, you may use Roar only with the involvement and consent of a parent or legal guardian. By using the Service, you affirm that you (or your parent/guardian if you are a minor) have read and agreed to these Terms. Parents or guardians of minors must supervise and are responsible for the minor's use of the Service, and by providing consent they agree not to hold Roar liable for any issues arising from the minor's use.

**Users 18 and Older:** If you are 18 or older (the age of majority in most jurisdictions), you represent that you are fully able to enter into these Terms on your own behalf.

The Service is intended for users in the United States. Use of the Service from outside the U.S. is at your own initiative, and you are responsible for compliance with any local laws.

## Account Registration and Security

To access certain features, you need to create a Roar account. When registering, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information about yourself. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account login credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. If you suspect any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security, you must notify us immediately. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to safeguard your account credentials.

You may only create one account for yourself and must not impersonate anyone or use false information. Roar reserves the right to suspend or terminate any account that we suspect is false, violates these Terms, or is being used in an unauthorized manner.

## Virtual Card and Payments

Roar may offer a virtual, team-branded debit card linked to your account for earning loyalty points on purchases ("Roar Card"). **Third-Party Issuer:** You acknowledge that the Roar Card and payment processing are provided in partnership with a third-party financial service (e.g. Stripe or another banking partner). By requesting or using the Roar Card, you agree to the Stripe Issuing terms or any applicable cardholder agreement from our issuing partner. You may be required to provide additional information for identity verification or compliance purposes when activating the card.

**Payment Processing:** All payment transactions (such as funding your card, purchasing a premium membership, or other transactions) are handled by third-party payment processors (like Stripe). Roar does not itself collect or store your sensitive payment information (e.g., full debit/credit card numbers) – such data is provided directly to our payment processor, and its use of your information is subject to their privacy policy. You are responsible for ensuring any payment information you provide is accurate and up-to-date.

Roar is not a bank and the Roar Card is not a traditional bank account. Funds loaded or spent via the Roar Card are held and managed by our third-party issuer under their terms. We make no warranties regarding the Roar Card services provided by third parties, and we are not liable for their actions. Any fees, transaction limits, or other card-related disclosures will be provided to you in a separate cardholder agreement or within the app.

## Fan Points and Rewards Program

Roar operates a loyalty rewards program whereby users earn Roar Points ("Points") for certain activities, such as making purchases with the Roar Card or engaging with partner merchants and teams. Your use of the Points program is subject to the following terms:

- **Earning Points:** Points accrue based on qualifying activities (e.g., spending with the Roar Card at participating merchants, promotional events, referrals, etc.). The rate of point earnings and qualifying actions will be described in the app and may change from time to time. Roar may set a maximum cap on points earned per period. Points will be credited to your account within a reasonable time after the qualifying activity, subject to verification.

- **Redeeming Points:** Points can be redeemed for rewards, such as exclusive content, access to events, merchandise, discounts, or other perks offered through the Roar platform. The available rewards and the point values required for redemption will be published in the app's rewards catalog or store. Redemption is subject to availability. Roar reserves the right to modify, replace, or discontinue any reward or the rewards catalog at any time.

- **No Cash Value & Non-Transferability:** Points are not cash or legal tender, and have no cash value or equivalent. Points cannot be redeemed for cash, nor refunded, exchanged, or transferred outside the Roar platform. Points are personal to your account and cannot be transferred or sold to another user, except via any official in-app gifting feature that Roar explicitly provides. (Any attempt to transfer or sell points in any other manner is a violation of these Terms and may result in forfeiture of points or account termination.) Points do not constitute personal property and are not the property of any user.

- **Point Adjustments:** If any purchase or transaction that earned Points is refunded, canceled, disputed, or reversed, or if it was subject to fraud or error, Roar reserves the right to deduct the corresponding Points from your account balance. Roar may also deduct Points if it determines that points were earned in violation of these Terms or through manipulation of the program.

- **Program Changes and Termination:** Roar may, at its discretion, change the Point earning rates, redemption values, or other aspects of the loyalty program. We may also impose expiration dates on Points (e.g., Points may expire after a certain period of inactivity or on a schedule announced in advance). We will endeavor to notify users of significant changes to the Points program (for example, via the app or email). Roar reserves the right to suspend or terminate the loyalty program or any user's participation in it at any time. If the overall program is terminated, Roar will provide notice and may allow a limited period for redemption of remaining Points; otherwise, any unredeemed Points will expire at program termination.

- **No Guarantees:** Earning and redemption of Points are provided as a promotional feature of the Service. Roar makes no guarantee that any particular reward will be available or that the loyalty program will continue indefinitely. Points are not a guarantee of receiving any particular benefit, and Roar is not liable for any loss of Points or rewards due to changes, cancellations, or termination of the program, except as explicitly provided in these Terms.

## Membership Plans and Subscriptions

Roar may offer membership tiers, including a free basic membership and a paid Premium Membership that provides additional perks (such as enhanced content access, higher earning rates, or other exclusive benefits). If you choose to subscribe to a Premium Membership or any other paid service:

- **Fees and Billing:** You agree to pay any applicable subscription fees and taxes. Premium Memberships are typically billed on a recurring basis (e.g., monthly or annually) as disclosed at the time of sign-up. By providing a payment method, you authorize Roar (or its payment processor) to charge the recurring subscription fee to that payment method. If a payment fails or cannot be processed, we may suspend or downgrade your membership until payment is resolved.

- **Auto-Renewal:** Subscriptions will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle (month-to-month or year-to-year) unless you cancel beforehand. We will charge your provided payment method on the renewal date, at the then-current subscription rate, until you cancel. Roar will inform you of any changes to subscription pricing or terms, and such changes will apply after your current subscription period unless stated otherwise.

- **Cancellation:** You may cancel a Premium Membership at any time through your account settings or by contacting customer support. If you cancel, you will continue to have access to Premium features until the end of your current paid period, and your subscription will not renew thereafter. No pro-rated refunds are provided for partial subscription periods; once a period is paid, the service will remain active until it expires. After cancellation, your account may revert to the free membership with limited features.

- **Changes and Termination:** Roar reserves the right to modify or discontinue membership plans (including adding or removing features or altering fees) at any time. If we discontinue a paid membership tier, we may migrate you to an equivalent service or provide a pro-rata refund for any remaining unused period. We will notify you of significant changes to your membership plan in advance when possible. If you violate these Terms or misuse the membership features, Roar may terminate your Premium Membership (and possibly your account) without refund.

All subscription fees are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated, and you are responsible for any currency conversion fees or bank charges. Any free trials or promotional offers for Premium Membership shall be governed by their specific terms, and Roar reserves the right to determine eligibility for and duration of free trials.

## Acceptable Use and User Conduct

We strive to maintain a respectful, safe, and enjoyable community for all fans. By using Roar, you agree not to misuse the Service and to adhere to the following rules of conduct:

- **Lawful Purposes Only:** You will not use the Service for any unlawful, fraudulent, or malicious purpose, or to facilitate or encourage any illegal activities. All content you access or share on Roar must comply with applicable laws and regulations.

- **Prohibited Content:** You will not post, upload, transmit, or share any content that is defamatory, obscene, pornographic, sexually explicit, harassing, threatening, abusive, violent, hateful, or otherwise objectionable or harmful. This includes content that is racist, sexist, discriminatory (e.g., based on race, gender, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, etc.), or that advocates violence or criminal activity. Be civil and refrain from hate speech, bullying, or personal attacks.

- **No Infringing or Unauthorized Content:** You must not upload or share content that you do not own or have the right to use. This includes unauthorized use of copyrighted material, trademarks, or any other proprietary content belonging to others. Do not post videos, photos, music, or other media of athletes, teams, or third parties unless you have permission. Also, do not misuse Roar's own content (see Intellectual Property section below for more details).

- **No Spam or Commercial Use:** Roar is for personal fan engagement. You will not use the Service to advertise or solicit any products, services, or commercial activities without our prior consent. This means no spam, junk mail, chain letters, pyramid schemes, or unsolicited mass distribution of content. You also agree not to collect or harvest any information about other users (e.g., emails) for commercial purposes.

- **No Harmful Technical Acts:** You must not introduce viruses, malware, Trojan horses, or other harmful code into the Service. You agree not to attempt to hack, attack, disrupt, or interfere with the proper working of Roar's platform, servers, or networks. This includes no attempts to circumvent any security or authentication measures, no DDOS attacks, or any action that imposes an unreasonable load on our infrastructure.

- **No Misrepresentation or Misuse:** Do not impersonate any person or entity (e.g., impersonating a Roar staff member, a team representative, or an athlete), or misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity. You also agree not to use the Service in a manner that could confuse others or violate any person's rights of privacy or publicity. For example, you may not post someone else's personal information without permission.

- **Fair Usage of Points & Features:** You will not abuse or game the loyalty Points system or any feature of the Service. Prohibited behaviors include creating fake transactions, using bots or scripts to earn points, exploiting bugs or errors for an unfair advantage, or fraudulently obtaining rewards. If we detect such activity, we reserve the right to invalidate affected points and take action on your account.

Roar reserves the right to investigate and take appropriate action against anyone who, in Roar's sole discretion, violates these rules of conduct. Actions may include removal of content, suspension or termination of accounts, forfeiture of Points or rewards, and cooperation with law enforcement authorities (if applicable).

## User-Generated Content and Communications

**Content Ownership:** Roar may include interactive features such as community forums, chat rooms, comment threads, or other venues where users can post content (including text, messages, images, or other materials). You retain ownership of any original content (e.g., posts or messages) that you create and share on the Service. However, by submitting or posting content on Roar, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable license to use, reproduce, modify (for technical purposes like resizing an image or reformatting), display, and distribute your content within the Service for the purpose of operating, developing, and improving the platform. This license is necessary for us to transmit and display your content as you intend (for example, showing your chat messages to other users). We will not use your personal content for any unrelated marketing purposes without your consent.

**Your Responsibilities:** You are solely responsible for any content that you post or transmit via Roar. This means you assume all risks related to it, including anyone else's reliance on its accuracy, or any claims arising from the content. By posting content, you represent and warrant that: (a) you own or have obtained all necessary rights to that content, and (b) the content does not violate any laws or infringe the rights of any third party (including intellectual property rights and privacy rights), and (c) the content complies with these Terms (see Acceptable Use rules above).

**No Endorsement:** Any opinions, advice, statements, or other information provided or made available by users in the Service are those of the respective user and not of Roar. We do not endorse and are not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, or legality of user-generated content. You understand that when using the Service, you may be exposed to content from a variety of users, and that we are not responsible for the content of others.

**Moderation:** Roar is not obligated to monitor user content, but we reserve the right to do so and to remove or edit any user submissions at our discretion, without notice. We may remove content that we deem to violate these Terms or that is otherwise objectionable. We may also disable or suspend users who repeatedly violate content rules or infringe intellectual property rights. If you believe any content on Roar violates your rights or the Terms, you can report it through the provided channels in the app or contact support.

**Messaging and Communications:** If you communicate with athletes, teams, or other community members through Roar (for example, in Q&A sessions, live chats, or forums), be respectful and follow the rules. Roar may monitor these communications to ensure a safe environment and compliance with these Terms. We may record and store chat transcripts or forum posts as needed to moderate the community and for safety.

Keep in mind that any content you share in public or community areas can be seen by others – do not share sensitive personal information in these public forums. Roar is not responsible for what other users do with information you share publicly.

## Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights

**Roar's Content:** The Service contains content provided by Roar, including but not limited to software, text, images, graphics, logos, button icons, videos, audio clips, athlete-generated content provided to Roar, editorial content, and the arrangement of these materials. All such content and materials are the property of Roar or its licensors (such as partner teams, athletes, or content creators) and are protected by intellectual property laws, including copyright, trademark, and other proprietary rights. Roar (and its licensors) retain all rights, title, and interest in and to the Service and all content therein, except for user-generated content as described above.

Roar's name, logo, and all related product and service names, design marks, and slogans are trademarks of Roar (the "Roar Marks"). Other trademarks, service marks, and logos that may appear in the Service, including team names, team logos, athlete names or likenesses, and third-party logos (e.g., merchant partners' names) are the property of their respective owners. Your use of the Service does not grant you any rights to use any of these marks or content for any purpose outside of the Service.

**Limited License:** Roar grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and use the Service and Roar's content for your personal, non-commercial use, solely as intended through the provided functionalities of the Service and in accordance with these Terms. This means you can view, stream, and participate in the content (such as watching exclusive videos, reading posts, using the app interface) for your own personal enjoyment and fan engagement. You agree not to reproduce, distribute, modify, create derivative works of, publicly perform, publicly display, republish, download, or transmit any of Roar's content (or the content of our partners) outside of the Service without our prior written permission or the permission of the rights holder. For example, you may not download and re-upload exclusive videos of athletes to another site, or sell any content you obtained through Roar.

**Exclusive Content:** Any exclusive content provided through Roar (such as athlete Q&As, videos, livestreams, or special events) is intended for your personal and private use only. You must not screen-record, screenshot, photograph, copy, or redistribute any such exclusive content. Unauthorized sharing or publishing of exclusive content (for instance, posting it on public websites or social media without permission) is a violation of these Terms and may result in account termination and further legal action if it infringes copyrights or other rights.

**Feedback:** If you choose to provide suggestions, ideas, or other feedback to Roar about the Service or new products/features, you agree that Roar is free to use and implement such feedback without any compensation or obligation to you. You hereby grant Roar a perpetual, sublicensable, worldwide license to use any feedback you provide for any purpose.

**Reservation of Rights:** All rights not expressly granted to you in these Terms are reserved by Roar and its licensors. No rights or licenses are granted by implication or estoppel.

## Third-Party Services and Links

The Roar platform may incorporate or provide links to third-party websites, products, or services to enhance your experience. For example:

- **Payment Processing:** As noted, we use third-party services like Stripe to process payments and power the Roar Card. When you engage in transactions (e.g., loading your card or paying a subscription), you may be redirected to or your information may be shared with Stripe or a similar payment provider for secure processing. These transactions are governed by the third party's terms and privacy policy, not solely by Roar.

- **Sign-On and Social Features:** We may allow you to sign up or log in through OAuth providers (such as Google, Apple, or others). If you choose to use these options, you are interacting with the third-party authentication service and may be subject to their terms. Similarly, the Service might enable sharing certain content to social media or integrating content (like embedding a YouTube/Vimeo video or social media feed within the app); such third-party content is subject to the third party's terms.

- **External Links:** Content on Roar (including user posts or partner content) may include links to external websites or resources that are not operated by us. For instance, a news article link, a partner merchant's site, or a team's official page might be accessible via the app.

We provide access to these third-party services or links for convenience and enhanced functionality. However, Roar does not own or control third-party services and websites. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible or liable for any third-party content, services, or websites, including their accuracy, reliability, or data practices. When you click such links or use third-party services, you do so at your own risk, and you understand that these Terms and Roar's Privacy Policy do not apply to those external services. We encourage you to review the terms and privacy policies of any third-party services you interact with.

**Third-Party Data Sharing:** Aside from the integrations described, Roar will not share your personal information with third parties for their own marketing without your consent (see Privacy Policy below for more details). Any sharing of data with our partner sports teams, athletes, or merchants (for example, to facilitate a reward or event entry) will be done in accordance with our Privacy Policy and, where possible, using aggregated or non-identifiable data.

If you have any issues arising from third-party interactions (for example, a payment dispute or a broken external link), please contact the third party directly or let us know so we can assist if possible. However, your agreement with that third party will govern your rights and remedies.

## Termination and Account Suspension

**By You:** You may stop using the Service at any time. You can also delete your account by following the procedures in the app or contacting Roar support. Deleting your account will terminate your rights to access the Service and any data associated with your account will be handled in accordance with our Privacy Policy (we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes).

**By Roar:** We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account or access to all or part of the Service at any time, for any reason, with or without notice, at our sole discretion. This includes, but is not limited to, situations where: (a) you have violated these Terms or any applicable law; (b) you engage in fraudulent or harmful behavior; (c) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; (d) you have been inactive for an extended period; or (e) our provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make a reasonable effort to notify you (for example, via the email associated with your account) of any such termination or suspension, when feasible.

**Effect of Termination:** Upon termination of your account, whether by you or by us, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. You will no longer have access to your profile or any content you have stored on the Service (so you should retain copies of any information you need beforehand). Any loyalty Points or rewards in your account at the time of termination may be forfeited and are not convertible to cash or compensation. If you had a Premium Membership, termination by us due to your breach may result in forfeiture of any remaining paid period without refund (if termination is without cause on our part, we may provide a pro-rata refund for prepaid services not received).

Roar shall not be liable to you or any third party for termination of your account or denial of access to the Service. Sections of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination (such as Intellectual Property, Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, etc.) will survive.

If your account is terminated and you believe it was in error, you may contact us to request review, but we are not obligated to reinstate the account.

## Disclaimer of Warranties

**Use at Your Own Risk:** The Roar Service and all content, information, and functionality made available through it are provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, Roar and its affiliates, licensors, partners (including teams, athletes, and merchants), and suppliers disclaim any and all warranties, express or implied, regarding the Service, content, and software. This includes, but is not limited to:

- **Implied Warranties:** All implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement are expressly disclaimed. We do not guarantee that the Service will meet your requirements or expectations.

- **No Guarantee of Accuracy or Availability:** Roar does not warrant that any content (including team schedules, athlete communications, points balances, or other information) is completely accurate, complete, reliable, or current. While we strive for accuracy, there may be inadvertent technical or factual errors. You understand that use of any information obtained through the Service is at your own discretion and risk. We also do not warrant that the Service will be available at any given time or location, uninterrupted or error-free. Roar is not responsible for any service outages or connectivity issues, or for any delay or failure in performance resulting from technical causes beyond our control (such as internet issues, downtime, attacks, etc.).

- **Security and Viruses:** We make efforts to maintain the security of the Service, but we do not guarantee that the Service will be secure, or free from bugs, viruses, or other harmful components. You are responsible for using your own device security measures (like antivirus software).

- **Third-Party Content:** Roar makes no warranties regarding any content or services provided by third parties (including our partner payment processor, or content posted by other users or third-party links). Any dealings you have with third parties are at your own risk.

**No Advice or Results Warranty:** Any advice or information (oral or written) obtained from Roar or through the Service does not create any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms. For example, any recommendations or tips provided in the app (like local merchant suggestions or team-related content) are for general informational purposes and come with no guarantee.

Roar specifically disclaims any warranty that use of the Service will result in any particular outcome or benefit for you – for instance, we do not promise that your participation will lead to any specific rewards, experiences, or that any particular event will occur.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, so some of the above exclusions may not apply to you. In such cases, any warranties required by law are limited in duration to the minimum period legally required.

## Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Roar and its parent company, affiliates, officers, employees, partners, licensors, and agents shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to your use of (or inability to use) the Service, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability covers, for example:

- Loss of profits or revenue, loss of goodwill, business interruption, or loss of data;
- Any loss of rewards or Points, or inability to redeem Points or access content;
- The cost of procurement of substitute goods or services;
- Unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data;
- Statements or conduct of any third party on the Service (including offensive or illegal conduct of other users or third parties);
- Any content obtained through the Service; or
- Events outside our reasonable control, such as network failures, force majeure events, or third-party service interruptions.

**Cap on Liability:** In jurisdictions where liability limitations are allowed, Roar's total cumulative liability to you for any claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service shall not exceed the amount (if any) that you paid to Roar for the service in the six (6) months immediately prior to the event giving rise to the claim, or US $100, whichever is greater. This means if you have not paid any subscription or fees to Roar in that timeframe, Roar's liability for any claim will be capped at $100.

**No Liability for Third-Party Conduct:** Roar is not liable for the actions or content of third parties, including other users, athletes, teams, or merchants. This includes any transactions or disputes between you and a third party (for example, if a merchant partner fails to honor a discount or if another user misuses content).

**Your Responsibility for Damage:** You are responsible for any damage to your device or loss of data that results from using the Service or downloading any material through the Service. Roar tries to keep the Service free of harmful content, but we cannot ensure that the Service or files you download will be free of viruses or contamination.

Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, in such places our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law. The limitations in this section shall apply even if any limited remedy fails of its essential purpose.

## Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Roar, its parent company, affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, partners, and agents (collectively, the "Roar Parties") from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) that arise out of or are connected to: (a) your use or misuse of the Service; (b) any content you submit, post, or share on the Service; (c) your violation of any portion of these Terms, any representation or warranty contained in these Terms, or any applicable law or regulation; or (d) your infringement of any intellectual property or other rights of any third party.

Roar reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and if we do so, you agree to cooperate with our defense of that claim. You agree not to settle any such matter without the prior written consent of Roar. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.

This indemnification obligation will survive the termination of your account or these Terms.

## Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

**Governing Law:** These Terms and any dispute arising out of or related to the Service or these Terms shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. However, if you reside outside of the United States, you may be entitled to invoke certain consumer protection rights under the laws of your country of residence, to the extent those rights are mandatory and cannot be waived by contract.

**Jurisdiction and Venue:** Except where prohibited by applicable law, you agree that any legal proceedings (other than small claims cases, if applicable) arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in the State of Delaware. You consent to the personal jurisdiction of those courts and waive any objection on grounds of inconvenient forum. If you are a U.S. resident, this clause does not override any rights you may have to a different venue under applicable federal or state laws (for example, certain consumer laws may permit filing in your state of residence).

**Arbitration Option:** At our sole discretion, Roar may require you to submit any dispute arising from these Terms or your use of the Service (including disputes arising from or concerning their interpretation, violation, invalidity, non-performance, or termination) to binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. In such case, the arbitration would be conducted on an individual basis in the State of Delaware or another mutually agreed location. By agreeing to arbitration, you understand that you are waiving certain rights to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Any arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor Roar may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award. (If this arbitration clause is not enforceable under the law of your jurisdiction, it shall be severed, and the remaining provisions of this section shall remain in effect.)

**Injunctive Relief:** Notwithstanding the above, Roar may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to protect its intellectual property rights or prevent loss of data or damage to its servers in any competent court.

## Miscellaneous

**Entire Agreement:** These Terms (along with the Privacy Policy and any additional guidelines, terms, or rules posted in the Service) constitute the entire agreement between you and Roar concerning the Service, and supersede all prior agreements or communications (whether oral or written) between you and us regarding the subject matter hereof.

**Waiver and Severability:** No waiver of any term or condition of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Roar's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full force and effect.

**Assignment:** You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. Roar may freely assign these Terms (in whole or in part) as part of a merger, acquisition, sale of business, or by operation of law or otherwise, without any notice to you.

**No Third-Party Beneficiaries:** These Terms are between you and Roar. Except as expressly provided in these Terms, no other person or entity shall be a third-party beneficiary to these Terms.

**Headings:** Section titles and headings in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
