# AI Video Script Generator - Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've created a comprehensive AI-powered video script generation system that uses Mistral AI SDK and Cerebras for fast inference. The system allows users to generate multiple script variations based on 24 research-backed attributes from short-form video ad best practices.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Agent Package (`packages/agent/`)
- **Core Agent System**: Multi-stage workflow following Anthropic's best practices
  - Stage 1: Analyze attributes and plan approach (Mistral)
  - Stage 2: Generate script variations (Cerebras Llama 3.3 70B)
  - Stage 3: Optimize scripts (Mistral)
  - Stage 4: Finalize results
- **Tools**: Following Anthropic's recommendations for clear tool interfaces
- **Types**: 24 video script attributes based on the research report
- **Database Service**: Handles persistence of generations and templates

### 2. Database Schema
- **video_script_generation**: Stores generation requests, progress, and results
- **video_script_template**: Saves attribute configurations for reuse
- Migration file created in `packages/database/drizzle/migrations/`

### 3. Website Integration (`apps/website/src/app/(agent)/`)
- **Protected Route**: `/agent` requires user authentication
- **Main Components**:
  - `video-script-generator.tsx`: Main interface with product info and attribute selection
  - `attribute-selector.tsx`: UI for selecting from 24 attributes with tooltips
  - `agent-flow-visualizer.tsx`: React Flow visualization of agent progress
  - `script-results.tsx`: Display generated scripts with copy/download features
- **Layout**: Navigation with links to the agent page

### 4. API Endpoints
- `POST /api/agent/generate`: Starts script generation
- `GET /api/agent/progress/[generationId]`: Server-sent events for real-time progress
- `GET/POST /api/agent/templates`: Manage saved templates

### 5. Key Features
- ✅ Multi-agent workflow with Cerebras for fast generation
- ✅ React Flow visualization of agent progress
- ✅ 24 research-backed video script attributes
- ✅ Real-time progress tracking with SSE
- ✅ Database persistence per user
- ✅ Template saving and reuse
- ✅ Authentication required
- ✅ Download scripts as text file
- ✅ Copy individual scripts to clipboard

## Technologies Used
- **AI Models**: 
  - Mistral Large (analysis & optimization)
  - Cerebras Llama 3.3 70B (fast script generation)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, React Flow, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, Drizzle ORM
- **Real-time**: Server-Sent Events for progress tracking
- **Authentication**: Existing auth system integration

## The 24 Attributes
Based on the research report, the system includes:

### Core Content
- Fast-paced hooks
- Conversational copywriting
- Dynamic visual style
- Relatable framing
- Strong CTAs

### Ad Formats
- Product demonstrations
- Customer testimonials
- Before/after transformations
- Storytelling narratives

### Content Approach
- Problem/solution framing
- Lifestyle integration
- Social proof
- Trend alignment

### Technical Elements
- Emotional appeal
- Visual richness
- Platform-native style
- Music/sound integration
- Text overlays/captions

### Optimization
- Brand integration
- Authenticity
- Brevity
- Mobile-first format
- Interactive elements
- Urgency/scarcity

## Next Steps
To complete the implementation:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run your package manager to install new dependencies
2. **Run Database Migration**: Apply the migration to create the new tables
3. **Set Environment Variables**: 
   - Add Mistral API key
   - Add Cerebras API key (if needed)
4. **Test the System**: Navigate to `/agent` when logged in

## Notes
- The system uses background processing for generation to avoid timeouts
- Progress is tracked in the database and streamed to the client
- Scripts are generated with visual/audio directions and duration estimates
- Each variation focuses on different attribute combinations for variety
